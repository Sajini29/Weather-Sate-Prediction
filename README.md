# Weather-Sate-Prediction

This study focuses on predicting weather codes for different cities in Sri Lanka by analyzing data spanning from 2010 to 2023. 
The analysis employs exploratory data analysis (EDA) and advanced techniques, including classical Multinomial Logistic Regression and Machine Learning, specifically Random Forest, to discern the key determinants of weather codes in the unique Sri Lankan context.
Hyperparameter-tuned Multinomial Logistic Regression displayed better performance among classical models. Additionally, within the realm of Machine Learning Techniques, the Decision Tree classifier with Bagging demonstrated superior performance across all classical and Machine Learning techniques. 
This study supports agriculture, tourism, and other crucial sectors by predicting weather states in Sri Lanka.
